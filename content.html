            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>I am currently a graduate student at UW Foster studying a degree in Information Systems. I am also a lab partner at the Starbucks Tryer Innovation Center.

            I have passions for process optimization & efficiency as well as data-driven decision making with the end user in mind. I love sharing my experiences in hopes of making others feel heard. In my free time you can find me with my dog, at the gym, or capturing moments on my film camera.</p>
